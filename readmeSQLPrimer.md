## Basic SQL facts:

* Each database row corresponds to a "record".

* Watch for good practices on designing databases. For example, customer information must be at a different database than, say, order information. This allows you to retrieve, for any order, the current, most updated information on the customer that made said order. A "client ID" would be responsible to connect, or to relate, information from the "orders database" to the "customers database". That's why a database system like this is called "relational". Because different tables are "related" just like in this example.

## Essential SQL Skills:

1. Retrieve Data

2. Insert Data

3. Update Data

4. Delete Data

There are minor differences in the SQL syntax used throughout different Database Management Systems. But over 90% of said is syntax is pretty much the same through all of them.

## Beyond-Basic SQL Skills:

1. Summarizing data for writing reports.

2. Writing complex queries using sub-queries.

3. Using mySQL (or other Relational Database Management System) built-in functions to work with numbers, dates, etc.

4. Creating views.

5. Creating stored procedures and functions. These are queries you can store for later re-usage.

## Advanced SQL Skills:

1. Triggers

2. Events

3. Transactions

4. Concurrency

## Further Advanced SQL Skills:

1. Database Design - you must develop your own systematic approach to optimal design.

2. Indexing for high performance. Know what indexes are, how do they work, and how to use them to speed up queries. Indexes are absolutely essential for large databases.

3. Database security. Know how to create several user accounts and manage the access privilege of each account.
